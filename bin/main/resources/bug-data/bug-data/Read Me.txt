bug  and developer files for JDT and Platform project milestones. The bug files are provided in 19 different milestones. JDT Milestone 3.1 is a milestone for JDT project. All the input (.txt) files start with JDT are for JDT project. The Platform input files starts with "Platform". 
For each milestone, some additional information are given in a .csv file with the same name as the project milestone.


********************************************************************************************
Description of Developer files (JDTDeveloper.txt(for JDT milestone bugs) and PlatformDeveloper.txt (for platform milestone bugs))
********************************************************************************************

1. The developer files have the profile matrix for all the develoeprs for corresponding projects.

2. The first row is the id of the developers and name of differnet components of JDT/Platform products.

3. The first column of each other rows represents the id of the developers.

4. The other columns (2 to 13) represents skill levels or productivity for the developers on the particular component. The productivity is defined relative to average productivity.

5. For a particular developer, a value 0 in profile column indicates that particular developer does not possess the skill in that profile.



********************************************************************************************
Description of Developer files with hourly wage Information (JDTDeveloperWithWage.txt and PlatformDeveloperWithWage.txt). Required if you bug fix cost is also considered

6. The last column indicates hourly wage of the developers



********************************************************************************************
Description of bug files (JDTMilestone3.1.txt, PlatformMilestone3.0.txt etc.)
********************************************************************************************

1. This file is provided as the input for the implementation.

2. The first column represents the bug id of a particular milestone.

3. The second column shows the manually assigned developer to the corressponding bugs.

4. The third column is the estimated effort requried to fix the corresponding bug in person hours.

5. The columns 4 to 15 represents the effort required (in percentage of total effort required) in corresponding components of JDT/Platform products.

CSV Files for Project Milestones
********************************************************************************************
Each JDT and Platform milestone projects have more information related to the bugs that we did not use in our experiments.


********************************************************************************************
Competency Graph (CompetencyGraph.txt):
********************************************************************************************

In each line of this file, the first number specifies the competency index on which subsequent competency indexes depends on. For example, in the given file
competency index 1 and 4 are dependent on competency index 2. The competency index order can be extracted from the header information in JDTDeveloper.txt and PlatformDeveloper.txt files or the relevant bug files

For example, from JDTDeveloper.txt files , we see the order of the competencies:

jdt	jface	core	swt	ui	debug	ltk	text	jdi	search	compare	other

So for the above example, competency areas 'jdt' (index 1) and 'swt' (index 4) depends on competency area  jface(index 2).

For platform projects, interpretation will be different from JDT projects for the same text file. We assume same sort of dependencies among competencies 
across all Eclipse JDT project milestones and all Eclipse Platform project milestones.



********************************************************************************************
Bug Dependency Graph:
********************************************************************************************

For each bug in a particular project milestones, bug dependency information can be found in the relevant csv file.
In a particular csv file, the 'Depends On' column in a row specifies the bug ids on which the bug represented by the row depends on.

For a project milestone, bug dependency graph can be constructed using all the bugs in the relevant text file and extracting 
their bug dependency information from the relevant csv file, searching with the bug id.
