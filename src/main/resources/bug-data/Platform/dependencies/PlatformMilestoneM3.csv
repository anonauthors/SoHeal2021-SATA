38842,, Make enabling and disabling expressions part of the debug framework.  ,,Darin_Wright@ca.ibm.com,enhancement,P3,6/12/2003 11:24,8/25/2003 16:04,,24,"It would be nice if enabling and disabling of expressions worked like it does 
for breakpoints.  Currently we have an enable button in our expression dialog 
like JDT does.  However, we ran some user sessions and discovered that people 
found this very confusing, they expected to be able to right click on the 
expression and enable or disable it rather than having to bring up an ""edit 
expression"" dialog.

If there were a canDisable() method on an expression then the menu items could 
show up only where appropriate (e.g. some Java expressions are only evaluated 
once and therefore it does not make sense to disable them)."

39567,, Use a Job for the BackgroundResourceRefresher  ,,Darin_Swanson@us.ibm.com,normal,P3,7/2/2003 16:59,8/21/2003 17:48,,8,"When resources are refreshed for a external tool that is run in the background

The ""New Updates"" action doesn't seem to reload a feature's JAR file.

To reproduce:
* Help->Software Updates->New Updates
* Search for new features to install
* Select a previously added site and press next (in my case the list was empty 
because I was up to date)
* Close the dialog
* Add a new version to the feature you had selected
* Try again

Result: The list of versions to install is still empty. If you 
unchecked ""Ignore features not applicable to this environment"", you will only 
see the old versions in the list."

handle deadlocks when syncExec collides with platform locks.  This should be
released to HEAD at the same time as the changes in org.eclipse.core.resources."
39757,, Some compare operations fail on resources that do not exist  ,,andre_weinand@ch.ibm.com,normal,P3,7/8/2003 11:00,8/25/2003 17:57,,12,"The Live Synchronize view can contain resources that do not exist locally. 
This has surfaced some problems in objectContributions that assume that all 
resources in a selection exist. To reproduce the test setup, load a project 
from CVS and delete a folder containing files. The outgoing deletions should 
appear in the Live Sync View (the folder will appear without the outgoing 
deletion icon).

Here is the list of compare operations and the test results. Either these 
operations should work or the menu operation should be disabled for non-
exitant resources.

- Replace With>Local History brings up the selection dialog which appears to 
work. However, chossing Replace fails with the error ""resource does not 
exist"". 

- Replace with>Previous from Local History also fails with ""resource does not 
exist.

- Restore from Local History works when performed on a deleted folder 
containing outgoing deleted files works

- Compare with>Each other fails when on of the resources doesn't exist (the 
resulting editor contains an Internal Error message.

- Team>Apply Patch is disabled for non-existant resources so it is OK."

generated, the SyncSet will reset its previously processed changes. This will 
cause the sync viewer to display improper state for some resources. The only 
known cause is deletion conflicts.

The best solution is to queue incoming events (both team and resource deltas) 
and have a job that processes them. The class where the queue should be used 
is SyncSetInputFromSubscriber.

Once this is completed, the method testDeletionConflicts() should be removed 
from the class SyncViewTests so that it will no longer obscure the real test 
in the superclass."

I created a project ""foo"" and shared it with a repo that already has ""foo"".  
CVS asked me if I wanted to sync, I said yes.  The Sync view opened showing me 
the changes to foo.  Of course, since I just creatd foo (and put a few things 
in it locally) there were many incoming additions.

I preferred not to have those files in foo so wanted in fact for the incoming 
additions to be outgoing deletions.  I was unable to get an ""override and 
commit"" menu entry to appear so tried commit (assuming that commit generally 
meant ""make the repo look like my workspace"").  I was prompted to add the 
sacrificial resource I had selected to version control.  I said yes.  I also 
added a comment.

It is unclear what would have happened but what did happen was a resource 
exception detailed below since foo did not exist locally.

Ignoring this problem, what exactly are the semantics of the term ""commit"".  
That is, can I do what I wanted?  What does it mean to commit an incoming 
change?  How is that positioned relative to ""update""?

After doing the following actions:
1. Got new synch info via Live Synch view
2. Pressed ""Conflicts"" button
==> multiple (> 3) password request dialogs were presented

If the CVS client automatcally retries to login instead of waiting for the first
password query to be answered by the user the account probably gets disabled
after the three automatic tries. This is bad since I can now no longer work
until my account gets reset by the administrator. Even worse. If I startup
Eclipse and it first tries the old invalid password more than once the opened
account gets closed again.

Note:
- I did not receive a request that my password has expired
- I did not get any useful message why my password was rejected
- nothing in .log"

1) Run a test suite that opens windows (I used IWorkbenchTest from the UI Suites)
2) Set a breakpoint in the suite
3) When the breakpoint is hit terminate the process
4) You will get a warning about an SWT error and a suggestion to close the

When I apply a patch to my workbench Eclipse will hang and has to be restarted.

I have synch set up for backgrund processing (all options on).

STEPS
1) Load the platform-ui module from the repository
2) Apply the patch (to be attached) to org.eclipse.jface
3) The last message before the hang is ""Preparing to Build"" so this looks 
related to the background builds"

  Problems accessing resource"" /org.junit/a.txt. Resource /org.junit/a.txt does
  not exist. Perform a refresh.

Refreshing from context menus in Navigator and Synchronize View doesn't solve
the problem. This bug is a real-world problem, which prevents me from continuing
my work after I have deleted an intermediary file. :-(

Steps to reproduce:

- take a fresh eclipse-SDK-I20030806-win32, new workspace
- create new cvs connection: :pserver:<a href=""mailto:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org"">anonymous@dev.eclipse.org</a>:/home/eclipse
- checkout [HEAD] org.junit
- choose menu ""Window > Show View"": Synchronize (the new one)
- Switch to show outgoing mode

- create new file with name ""a.txt"" in org.junit, type some characters, save
- expand org.junit in Synchronize view
- click on leftmost button in Synchronize View's toolbar (Refresh ...)
- click on file ""a.txt"" in Navigator, press del key, confirm deletion
- create new file with name ""b.txt"" in org.junit, type some characters, save
- open context menu on org.junit in Navigator and choose ""Team > Create Patch""
- click ""Finish""
- Voila, there's the error. What can I do?"

1) Create a new Java project.
2) Create a file in the project called abc.txt - leave the editor for this 
file open.
3) Edit abc.txt outside of eclipse and save the changes.
4) Select the file in the Package Explorer and refresh from the context menu.

The editor does not show the changes made to the file.  Close the editor and 
reopen it and you will see the changes.

Expect to see the changes immediately.  This works on Windows.

You can also see the failure if you use a file in CVS and replace with latest

This seems to be always reproducible (regardless the VM in use): when doing a
massive organize imports operation on a project, if you try to cancel it, a dead
lock will occur.

Steps:
1 - select a Java project in the Project Explorer
2 - press Ctrl-Shift-O (Organize imports)
3 - when the progress dialog appears, press the cancel button. Eclipse will
freeze (no CPU activity).

42027,, Incorrect worker pool logic causing too many thread creations  ,,john_arthorne@ca.ibm.com,major,P3,8/26/2003 16:55,9/4/2003 17:11,,97,"Build: I20030826

The job worker pool has the following logic to decide if a new thread needs to
be created:

if ((busyThreads >= threadCount && threadCount < MAX_THREADS) || (job != null &&
job.getPriority() == Job.INTERACTIVE))

This intends to read: ""start a new thread if all threads are busy and we are
still below the max thread count, OR, if the job is INTERACTIVE and hence must
be run no matter what.

However, the brackets are wrong.  The crucial bug is that it starts a new thread
if the job is INTERACTIVE even if there are threads that are not busy.  This is
causing hundreds of threads to be created when they don't necessarily need to.

The fix is to switch the brackets:

if (busyThreads >= threadCount && (threadCount < MAX_THREADS || (job != null &&
job.getPriority() == Job.INTERACTIVE))) {"

1. Create a Hello, world plug-in project
2. Right-click on the plug-in's build.xml and select 'Create Ant Build File'
3. Right-click on the build.xml from 2. and select Run Ant...
  I got a dialog asking me: ""The specified Ant runtime classpath does not 
include a tools.jar library.  This may affect the ability to use various 
tasks.  Ignore this possible problem?""
I answered yes.
4. An identical dialog reappeared.  Answered yes.
5. The Ant launch config. dialog appeared.
6. Click on the Classpath tab, the dialog appears again.  If you answer no, an 
error overlay appears, and the 'Run' button is disabled.
7. If you repeat 5 and 6 and answer 'no' in 6, you can run, but the following 
error appears:
""[filename:50]: Unable to find a javac compiler: com.sun.tools.javac.Main is 
not on the classpath.  Perhaps JAVA_HOME does not point to the JDK.

42084,, [ruler] Quickdiff doesn't disappear when saving  ,,eclipse@tom.eicher.name,normal,P3,8/27/2003 5:50,8/28/2003 4:06,,129,"build 200308261317

to reproduce:

1) Open a file in the java editor, make sure that the quickdiff reference is set
to ""file on disk""
2) change something
3) observe: you get a quickdiff indication in the vertical ruler
4) save
5) Since the reference version is the file on disk, you'd expect the quickdiff
indication to disappear, it does not.
If you reselect the ""file on disk"" item from the quickdiff reference context
menu, the quickdiff indication disappears."

I got the following class cast exception in Java Search using a Working Set

STEPS
1) Open the JavaSearch Dialog
2) Select a working set (I made one called properties which had just 
org.eclipse.ui.views.properties in it)
3) Enter a search string (I entered focusLost)
4) Hit Search - nothing happens and exception is printed to log:

Note this is fine using the Workbench search scope
