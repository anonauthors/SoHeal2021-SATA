9355,, Collapse function for block of code and comments hiding  ,,platform-text-inbox@eclipse.org,critical,P3,2/9/2002 14:50,8/17/2004 10:00,,15,"1. Collapse function should be able to collapse block of code between ""{"" 
and ""}"" into a single line looking something like ""{ ... }"", displayed in 
different color or style. 
2. As an addition to bracket matching, there should a way to display an 
vertical line starting just under opening ""{"" going all the way down to 
matching closing ""}"", if one exists. This should be configurable in terms of 
color and turning on/off.
3. For the comments, there should be a button which would either display the 
comments or hide them. When hidden, special marker would be displayed one 
character space left from where the comments were and this marker should take 
only one character space, or none if possible. It should be like the comments 
in MS Excel. 
4. When 3. combined with 1., there should be another configuration item, that 
would turn on/off displaying comments in collapsed block of code.

This would make handling large/complex pieces of code much easier. If code can 
be also printed as it is displayed, it would be great."

a way to keep their different projects or work items separate. Currently, this

directory inside where the code for Eclipse is installed. Eclipse should 
improve how workspaces get opened, use a user-specific default workspace

I just ran the M1 release by without my configuration, created a new Java

47295,, Hard to pin down a console  ,,krbarnes@ca.ibm.com,enhancement,P3,11/22/2003 20:08,5/17/2004 11:22,,85,"I usually run with the ""Show when program writes to standard out"" option 
turned ON. But sometimes I run more than one program at a time so the console 
view flips quickly back and forth between the two programs as they produce 
output. While this is going on, you can't select a different console to look 
at because Eclipse will immediately flip back to the active one.

I try pressing Pin Console, and it does temporarily stop the flipping. I can 
switch to a different view that overlays Console, and Console will come up to 
the top as soon as there is output. So far so good.

However when I select another console using the Display Selected Console 
dropdown view menu, the Pin Console button is unselected and it starts 
flipping back and forth again.

Enhancement #1: Leave the Pin Console on. Selecting another console should 
switch to that console but leave it pinned so it doesn't switch back.

If I click in the Debug view, the console window changes to the output of the 
process I clicked on. This is very nice, especially when you have more than a 
couple processes running with similar names (making the dropdown hard to use). 
Unfortunately it doesn't work when Pin Console is selected.

Enhancement #2: Make clicking in the Debug view work just like the Display 
Selected Console dropdown - switch to the selected console whether or not Pin 
Console is enabled. If it's enabled, stay there and leave it enabled.

Just to clarify, I'm suggesting that the ""Show when program writes to standard 
out/error"" option continue to make the console view visible and on top of its 
stack when there is output. If Pin Console is OFF, it should also switch to 
the process that had output like it does now. But if Pin Console is ON, it 
should leave the currently displayed console alone.

These two changes will make the console window much easier to pin down, and 
I'm hoping they're not very difficult to implement."

page as their contributed page to the Properties View, and in our case, the GEF

For the properties view, returning a custom propertysheet page means that your 
Table widget is unique to the editor.  So, if the user resizes the columns in 
instance 1, and then switches to instance 2 of the same editor type, the 
columns have to be resized again.

For the GEF palette, shared behavior would be the expansion of drawers and 
other UI state which has no reason to be instance based.

We need this behavior for GEF 3.0, so if it isn't implemented, we will have to 
implement it.  But, if we do it, propertysheet clients would not benefit.  I'd 
be happy to commit the fix."

49264,, need to support empty partition  ,,platform-text-inbox@eclipse.org,normal,P3,12/22/2003 6:41,4/23/2004 9:18,,63,"from <a class=""bz_bug_link

   title=""RESOLVED FIXED - 3.0 ContentAssistant change breaks code assist auto activation""
   href=""show_bug.cgi?id=49212"">bug 49212</a>, comment one: 

I'd appreciate some indicatation that this problem will be addressed or if it is
considered a feature one must adapt to. For some time I've been considering just
replacing the ContentAssistant, but I see you are in the process of generalizing
it, and I would rather stick with it if possible.

Other problems that have been in ContentAssistant for quite awhile and need fixing:

1. Auto assist should not be triggered when a backspace character is typed. This
can be very annoying. At the very least, this should be optional behavior.

2. Assist is too naive about the nature of partitions. 

It is easy to see the effect in an XML file. If the cursor is here:

  <foo> | </foo>

and the user types an auto-assist trigger for text partitions, code assist comes
up. But if the cursor is here:

  <foo>  |</foo>

and the user types the same character, code assist is not triggered. This is
because (prior to 3.0) the caret position would be considered to be in the
</foo> partition, and the trigger valid in text is not valid in tags. Users
constantly encounter this in flowed text, where very often the cursor is
""pushing"" an end tag.

There are two basic kinds of partition: delimited and undelimited. In a
delimited partition, the caret position at the partition offset is not logically
inside the partition. Using the type of the preceding partition, if any, to
select the activation characters is often a better choice (if the preceding
paritition is undelimited) and in any event not worse.

The current logic is like:

  Get partition at position.
  Use type of partition to select content assist processor
  Call processor to get auto activation characters

I would like it to be:

  Get partition at position.
  If position == partition offset
  and partition type is delimited
  and position > 0 then
    Get partition at position-1.
  Use type of partition to select content assist processor
  Call processor to get auto activation characters

The ability to determine whether a partition is delimited would be useful in a
number of other contexts, as well.

This solution would depend on a fix for the current bug."
49287,, No specific feedback if commit fails  ,,platform-team-inbox@eclipse.org,normal,P3,12/22/2003 15:47,5/18/2004 14:53,,8,"I did the following:

- Modified the same file (managed by CVS) on two computers in such a way that
CVS could not automatically merge the changes.

- Committed the changes on machine A.

- Performed an update on machine B.

- Didn't realize that I needed to manually merge the affected file, so I tried
to commit machine B's project to the repository.

- This failed (becuase the affected file had not been merged), but the error
message that I got just said that the CVS commit failed without indicating the
reason.

What I expected:

When a CVS commit fails becuase a file needs to be merged manually and this has
not been performed, I would expect to receive a specific message identifying the
file that needs merging along with indicating that the specified file needs to
be manually merged.  Bonus points if there is a one-click way to open the
identified file so I can fix it. :-)"

In Debugland, we'd like to present the user with relevant views when they switch 
between debugged languages (represented as contexts). As such, we're providing 
support for ""context view bindings"" which allow contributors to specify which 
views should be made available when a context is active.

It's possible that we need to open a view and it will appear on the same stack 
as a currently visible, applicable view. In this case, we want the newly opened 
view to appear underneath the currently visible one. For example, if you have 
the Variables view open and visible and then you switch to the ""Java Debugging"" 
context, the Display view will be opened on top of the Variables view. With this 
API, we'll be able to open the Display view with minimal visual disruption for

The way the polling preference is presented makes it look like the autorefresh feature relies on 
polling to do its job. Unless things have changed since Jed wrote it, however, autorefresh normally 
doesn't poll at all, but relies on natives for ""interrupt-driven"" updates.

The polling preference should somehow let the user know that it will only be used if the native 
notifications fail. Ideally, the autorefresh plug-in should know whether or not the native support is 
there, so it should be able to tell the user whether or not the preference will have any effect. 
Maybe, the preference could even be hidden if the autorefresh plug-in detects that it won't be 
used? At the very least, though, there should be text there (even if it has to be verbose) to inform 
the user of the setting's implications."

the functionality would be exposed in a way that we could (at least) look up

have* feature where we could automatically migrate preferences from existing
workspaces in new versions of the product. However, refactoring and redesigns
from the previous version have motivated the change of plugin names and
preference names. We have the necessary framework to invoke the migration, but
we need access to the existing values and ideally we would be able to transfer

proven to be an excellent feature.  But now I am starting to develop in Linux 
where the Eclipse driver is located in a shared directory owned by the root - 
each user launches it specifying a different workspace with the -data option.

The problem with this configuration (which appears to be really reasonable) is 
that there is no simple way of allowing each user to set the plugins the link 
files in the links folder should point to.

What about having the links folder defined as an argument (such as the 
workspace)?  Even better, to have an option to define more than one workspace 
(the order in the command line would define the precedence in case of 
duplicated plugin.  This could be something like

2. The first time you press the Browse button, it opens a (native) file selection dialog initialized to 
the Eclipse install directory.
3. After applying a patch, subsequent invocations of the Apply Patch dialog will initialize the file 
location field to the location of the last patch.
4. Pressing the Browse button, however, still initializes to the Eclipse install directory.

In step 2, the file selection dialog should be initialized to the user's home directory instead of the 
Eclipse install directory. User's generally don't (and shouldn't) store patch files in that location.

The CVS tasks do not fail on Eclipse 3.0 M7 running on my Mac OS X 10.3.3 (Java SDK 1.4.2_03).  This

Not sure if this is Update or PDE-build, but it happens upon startup so Update 
is a good place to start.

Upon startup as witnessed by Olivier and Jeff, the following error is logged 
to the console (i.e. nothing in the log).

Unable to find feature.xml in directory 
d:\test\eclipse\features\org.eclipse.pde.container.feature_1.0.0


First of all, this is the name of the fake feature that PDE generates to house 
the plug-ins the user is exporting.  We create this feature in our own 
metadata area and delete it at the end.

So the questions are:
1. How/Why/When is it detected by Update?
2. How is Update looking for it in the root Eclipse install at the next 
startup?

I remember that at some point Pascal collaborated with Christophe when coming 
up with pde-build story, and Pascal actually builds a site to house the 
features being built.  He does so by calling Update's State API.  So maybe 
these calls cause Update to think that there is a new feature in the root 
install."

sync'ing really takes long. I have a burst for about 5-10 sec. at the beginning

on the local machine). Then net traffic drops to 1-2k (both read and write)
while local CPU is idle (0%) and remote cvs is at approx. 1% CPU. At this state,
the remaining sync process takes approx. 5 minutes.
I figured this has something to do with attic files/directories. When I uncheck
the option ""Fetch absent or new directories while updating"", the project
synchronizes in 5-10 sec (the traffic burst mentioned above) as compared to 5+

60997,, Hard coded colour making text unreadable  ,,kim_horne@ca.ibm.com,normal,P3,5/5/2004 1:22,7/6/2004 9:29,,10,"The popup menu to select an editor (used when there are many editor windows
open) is hard coded to a background colour of white.  This is fine if you use a
typical text colour of black.  It's very bad if you use an inverted colour
display scheme, as you end up with pale text on a white background, which is
effectively unreadable (especially on a laptop screen).  

The correct behaviour should likely be something along the lines of using the
platforms default tooltip colour, or at least the default text editor background
colour (note, that haven't seen any other popup menus in eclipse with this problem).

The offending code would appear to be in
org.eclipse.ui.internal.presentations.EditorList , in the constructor:

    public EditorList(Shell parent, int shellStyle, int treeStyle) {
        super(parent, shellStyle, treeStyle);
        setBackgroundColor(new Color(parent.getDisplay(), 255, 255, 255));
    }

<RANT>I know I don't need to remind you eclipse folks, as you've done a
commendable job so far;  for everyone else out there (especially web designers):
 if you 'must' hardcode a background colour, you __must__ hard code the
forground colour as well!!!!</RANT>

61025,, List features not enabled via command API  ,,birsan@ca.ibm.com,enhancement,P3,5/5/2004 8:33,5/8/2004 22:37,,124,"The API lets you list features that are enabled in the configuration, but not 
those installed in sites that the config knows about that are not enabled.

This can be seen in the Product Configuration dialog when you select the 
disabled features toggle.

Use case is an ISV trying to install their software on a target product who 
checks for their pre-reqs up front.  They can only see configured features so 
they say no - we can't install or worse, install the missing features again.  
If they could list disabled features then after the first search they could ask 
again - is the feature there but disabled?

The API should either add an option to the current command, or a new command.  
Maybe the implementation should be a list all features and each includes an 
attribute (prefix or suffix) that identifies state.  
Maybe it should be:
-command allFeatures

I don't see this as an option on the API doc page:

site.  It required the .eclipseextnsion file in the eclipse dir (or we were 
warned that it would be soon).  All fine.

I just grabbed 0504 and tried the above.  I had been browsing to my target dir:
d:\mystuff\eclipse and saying go.  This no longer works in 0504.  I have to 
browse to d:\mystuff instead.  

I remember text flying by that said if we forgot the \eclipse on the command 
API that you would add it.  But I did not take that to mean that we could not 
add it ourselves (at least in the UI). 

If both d:\mystuff\eclipse and d:\mystuff are accepted (assuming that 
\eclipse\.eclipseextension exists) that is fine.  But seems wrong that you

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1) Open the synchronize view with the button to see outgoing changes selected
2) Select one of your projects for which you will have incoming changes
3) Execute a synchronization with the server
4) When this is done, you got n changes in the progress view.
5) Clicking on the link below the synchronization job goes to the Synchronize view.

The label at the bottom still says that there is no incoming changes (0), but if
you click on the incoming changes button at the top of the view, the label is
refreshed with the right number of incoming changes.

I'd like the label to directly show the number of incoming changes without
needing to click on the incoming change button."

external entites, the content type is not identified as an Ant buildfile but 
rather a general XML file.

I believe this is incorrect as the root element is still a project element.

Example file:

<?xml version=""1.0""  encoding=""iso-8859-1""?>
<!DOCTYPE project   [
<!ENTITY simplecommon SYSTEM ""simplecommon.xml"">
]>

When a compile error is introduced into a class that has an outgoing change, the
package and folders show the red X error icon. However, folder/packages in that
project that come before that file also incorrectly show the red X error icon.
Furthermore, once the compile error is fixed, these folders/packages still show
the icon when the corrected file's package does not.

Steps that I used to reproduce (may be a simpler way):
1. Create a bogus() method in an easily accessible class.
2. In a class in a project that has multiple changes, and it is in at least the
second package that has changes, call this bogus() method.
3. Delete the bogus() method from the first class.
4. Error icons are displayed on the project + package of the second class, as
well as the package that comes before this second class.
5. Remove the call from the bogus() method from the second class.

63345,, Build delta frequency  ,,john_arthorne@ca.ibm.com,normal,P3,5/20/2004 19:14,5/20/2004 19:52,,18,"Let me tell a story about two friends, the PRE_BUILD and POST_BUILD resource
change events.

In Eclipse 2.1, PRE_BUILD fired before autobuilds, and POST_BUILD fired after
autobuilds. Neither of them ran before manual builds.

In the last month, we decided that PRE_BUILD and POST_BUILD must also occur
before and after manual builds. This is because project references are now
computed dynamically, and the project reference providers need an opportunity to
let us know when they have changed *before* any kind of building happens.
Otherwise, the build won't happen in the correct order.

So, as of last week, PRE_BUILD occurred before the first build of an operation,
and POST_BUILD happened at the end of any operation in which a build occurred.
By ""end of operation"" here, I mean when our core operation depth counter reaches
zero.

It turns out, of course, that workspace operations can overlap each other in
Eclipse 3.0. This means that the operation depth might not reach zero until much
later, at the end of an operation that began before the build completed. If the
overlapping operation did not have a scheduling rule on the workspace root, then
a failure would occur if a POST_BUILD listener modified a resource outside the
scope of that operation's rule. See <a class=""bz_bug_link 
          bz_status_RESOLVED  bz_closed""
   title=""RESOLVED FIXED - java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Attempted to beginRule: P/org.eclipse.swt, does not match outer scope rule: P/org.eclipse.jface""
   href=""show_bug.cgi?id=62927"">bug 62927</a> for an exact test case.

Last night, I attempted to release a fix for this. My fix was to fire POST_BUILD
at the first ""endOperation"" after the PRE_BUILD event. I.e., the next time the
operation depth is decremented after the PRE_BUILD. This fix was short-sighted.
It meant that POST_BUILD would now occur *during* the build, the first time any
builder modified a resource (causing a nested operation to begin and end). In
addition, this fix caused the JDT core test suites to fail.

Now, we reach the dramatic conclusion of the story. 'Twas the night before M9, I
am about to leave on vacation, very few people are around, and I have to perform
11th hour changes to when resource change events occur. I cannot come up with a
reasonable rule for exactly when POST_BUILD should occur. It must happen after
PRE_BUILD, and immediately before the last time that the thread that performed
PRE_BUILD is going to release the scheduling rule required to perform
POST_BUILD. Essentially what I need to do is maintain the operation depth pre
thread, and then perform POST_BUILD when the operation depth of the thread that
performed PRE_BUILD is about to go lower than the the depth it was at when
PRE_BUILD occurred. Then I began thinking: How would I explain this story to
other components? It feels that the rule for when PRE_BUILD and POST_BUILD is
now too complex for anyone to reasonably understand.

So, I have opted for a simpler solution, at least for M9.  I am now doing
PRE_BUILD immediately prior to *every* API build call (IWorkspace.build,
IProject.build), and POST_BUILD immediately after every build. This means more
of these events are occurring in the scenario where a group of projects are
built one after another in an operation. This may have performance implications.
I have run all platform core and JDT core test suites, without failures. It
looks like it will do for M9. We can discuss next week if this makes sense as
the final answer for 3.0."
