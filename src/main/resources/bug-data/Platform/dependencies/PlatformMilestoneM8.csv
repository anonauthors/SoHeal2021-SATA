When this option is on, file data is sent from the server to the client during 
a synchronize.  While the data transfer is required for the function to work, 
this will have an undesired effect on slow links and large binary files.

There are a number of options that could be implemented.

1) Leave it alone.  The user should turn it off if they don't want the feature.
2) Don't apply this option to binary files.  IE File contents for binary files 
are never considered.
3) Don't apply this option to ""large"" files.  (We can either hard code 
what ""large"" is or let the user specify a size).
4) Remove this option since it seems unecessary since commit will not commit a

40709,, structuring managing 3.0 plugins  ,,birsan@ca.ibm.com,normal,P3,7/24/2003 9:24,3/3/2004 13:12,,164,"As we move towards RCP the ""platform"" becomes harder to define.  For example, 
looking at the UI RCP proposal, much of the function now lumped together in the 
constellation of UI plugins will be made separable and more independent.  With 
this will come the need/desire to have some but not the others.  The same is 
true of things like Resources, Help, Search, ...

Currently the unit of install/update is the feature.  In going forward with the 
factoring, we also have to consider how that will play in the feature world.  
Having a very low plugin:feature  ratio is disappointing as the aggregation or 
grouping power of features is reduced/ignored.  However, the current 
update/install story does not allow the same plugin to be mentioned in multiple 
features in the same feature ""requires"" graph.  I don't fully recall the 
reasoning for this but sense it had to do with product service and support 
issues.

I am not proposing anything specific.  Rather I just wanted to raise the issue 
and make people aware that it will ave to be addressed.  I suspect we should 
have story by about M4."
40783,," Doc: Change default value for ""match"" attribute of included features  ",,konradk@ca.ibm.com,enhancement,P3,7/25/2003 11:47,2/27/2004 2:20,,206,"In the past, 'include' element did not have 'match' attribute. Therefore, all 
included features were looked for using the exact ID and version 
(a.k.a. 'perfect'). When we introduced the 'match' attribute, we wanted to 
preserve backward compatibility, so features without 'match' are considered to 
have match=""perfect"". This is different from the defaults for 'match' 
attribute when appearing in 'requires' element in both plugins and features. 
We have this well documented but people normally count on the analogy without 
reading the doc.

Since this is a common source of confusion, we may switch to 'compatible' 
being the default in 3.0, where we have more freedom for breaking changes.
	
So, the request is to change the default value for the 'match' attribute of 
the 'include' element from 'perfect' to 'compatible'."
40920,, [resources] RefreshLocal Ant task message need re-wording  ,,platform-resources-inbox@eclipse.org,normal,P3,7/29/2003 18:51,3/4/2004 11:23,,38,"There was a post on the newsgroup about using the cvs task and refreshLocal to

41245,, [Fonts] Dialog.applyDialogFont() doesn't work on MacOSX  ,,Tod_Creasey@ca.ibm.com,normal,P3,8/7/2003 6:22,5/10/2005 14:54,,6,"I20030806

On MacOS X in Dialog.java, line 816 the expression
       control.getFont().equals(defaultFont)
evaluates to false even if no specific font has been set for the control.
One reason for this is that on MacOS X different controls use different sizes of the same font, so 
there is no single default font.
I'm not sure whether this is a JFace problem (assuming every Control uses the same defaultfont) or 
a SWT problem (returning different fonts form Control.getFont() even if the font is conceptually the 
default font)."

copied the above shortcut into

Starting with a clean C:\local\eclipsecfg\ec3\config directory i click on the
shortcut icon into Quick Launch toolbar, start working normally with eclipse,
then exit.

Now with C:\local\eclipsecfg\ec3\config directory directory containing the
platform.cfg.metadata dir and platform.cfg file created from previuos run, i
double click on C:\local\eclipsecfg\bin\eclipse3 shortcut starting eclipse and
here we go, Update manager starts looping.

The initial splash screen flashes on and off, the .log file keeps filling with
messages saying that all the plugins contained into
/local/eclipsecfg/ec3/eclipse-base and /local/eclipsecfg/ec3/eclipse-tools
are duplicated and the C:\local\eclipsecfg\ec3\config\platform.cfg.metadata dir
keeps filling with v2ConfigXXXXXXXXXXXXX.xml files.

Indeed the v2ConfigXXXXXXXXXXXXX.xml file created from the previus run contained
only single site entries for
   <site url=""file:C:/local/eclipsecfg/ec3/eclipse-base/eclipse/""

while in all the v2ConfigXXXXXXXXXXXXX.xml created during the loop the previous
entries are duplicated.

To stop the thing i must kill the eclipse process.

Now lets clean the C:\local\eclipsecfg\ec3\config dir and reverse the procedure.
Double click on C:\local\eclipsecfg\bin\eclipse3 shortcut, start working
normally with eclipse, then exit.
Now click on the shortcut icon into Quick Launch toolbar and start looping again.

So independently on wich shortcut you use first, till you countinue to use the
same you have no problem.

For now what happens is the following:
  - the configurator starts, the PlatformConfiguration is used to find a .cfg

the reconciler becomes the application to start. 
When the reconciler is running, the PlatformConfiguration is again used to find 
a .cfg, etc, etc. and also creates platform.cfg.metadata stuffs.

Basically if we run the reconciler, the same work is done twice, and if we do 
not run the reconciler the .cfg and some other infos are missing.

So it seems to me that the configurator should be the reconciler part of

This update.core would also have to talk to the framework to install the

- the new name of the plug-in would be 'Eclipse Forms'
- it would have an ID 'org.eclipse.ui.forms'
- it would be a part of the RCP workbench (having dependencies to JFace, 
editor code etc.) as an optional part of RCP offering.
- it would contain API and internal packages.

with the CVS Client for general Sync usage and for Branching/ Merging.

When things go wrong, I've typically copied the source folders to a backup 
location. Indeed this is now my standard practice before any Branch/ Merge 
operations are attempted.

However, when a Merge fails and I wish to manually bring in work from a backed-
up source tree, there seems no operation to Connect my folders into CVS; 
without unwanted commits on *every* file.

Basically Eclipse seems to offers absolute 'Checkout', 'Replace' 
and 'Disconnect' operations, and what seems to be a relative 'Synchronize' 
operation, but no absolute 'Connect' operation.

Such an absolute operation would determine & correct Local & Remote states of 
all files, without reference to previous local CVS tags; providing the means to 
repair damaged states & giving 'operational completeness' of workspaces against 
CVS state.

... Having experimented somewhat with the CVS preferences, and having used the 
Sync Refresh with Remote option, I don't believe these are offer an 'Absolute' 
state operation.

They may or may not be close - I couldn't get much useful improvement out of 
the 'compare content' option - but complete Operability & Repair capability on 
the cvs state would require that I could specify, for some folder tree, what 
CVS revision I was installing my source folders into. Based on this it would 
determine changes with respect to that revision and retag files.

I've had to reengineer CVS sync & reintegrate changes manually a couple of 
times now. One 'window' for problems is to Merging from a branch, and then 
continuing work in that branch. The Merge operation does not create a new 
version or whatever tag to define the merged-from point, so further work will 
not be correctly mergable.

The Absolute 'Connect' operation would have been ideal for that situation, as 
it would be ideal for any and all situations where code has been worked on 
elsewhere, or restored from backup, or sync has been damaged, and any or all 
other problem situations. So I'd really be quite keen to see such a capability."

Looking through the preference pages, there are a lot of colors that are
configurable by various plugins.  Our color manager should help, but will
introduce another problem : the color list will be huge!  Perhaps we need to
introduce the idea of a color category - You select your color category from a
drop down in order to limit the list and focus your search.  A category would be
a specific piece of functionality that has a group of colors.  ie: PDE Editor,
Java Annotations.

perhaps, use a property dereference to in the <import file=""""/> declaration. To
accomediate this an action in the views could prompt the user with a dialog
allowing him to associate the import with a specific file in the file system.

   href=""show_bug.cgi?id=42792"">bug 42792</a>]

I can't merge single files with another CVS branch -- but for the whole project,
it works.

Steps (my real example was in jdt.ui.tests.refactoring, which is very huge):
- checkout project org.junit from HEAD
- on file 'plugin.xml', call context menu > Team > Merge...
- select R2_1 as starting point
- select branch JUNIT381 to merge changes from
- click 'Finish'
=> Now I get the log entries below.
Note that it works fine if I do the same steps on the project directory.

I opened the Synchronize View's view menu (the down-pointing black triangle) and
chose 'Preferences...'. There I changed the setting 'Show all synchronization
information in a resource's text label'. After pressing 'OK', I got the error.

Before it happened, I was fiddling around with flat/hierarchical layout and
updating incoming changes. There was no synchrinization going on in background.
Unfortunately, I couldn't reproduce the error in another workspace. I first
could reproduce it in the original workbench, but not after restarting eclipse.

3.0 M6

While using the Plugin Registry view, i noticed that some extension points 
showed up with non-localized names.  Perhaps missing resource translations 
should be logged to the platform log, as it indicates the programmer has 
forgotten to translate something.  I got htis list by logging MREs in the 
BundelModel class.

Here is a list of all the missing resource keys (and their plugin) that i 
could 
find:

is active.  This never happened before.  It causes flashing and extra layouts 
of hte toolbar.  Also, our outline page retargets some of the editor's 
actions.  But now the actions aren't visible.

And, our custom contribution item's control is being disposed.  When disposed, 
it removes itself as a part listener, so when it is later recreated, it 
doesn't receive part notification.  Why are item's being disposed and then 
having fill(Toolbar) called again??"

visible but a comparison with the repository reveal 4 or 5 outgoing changes. 
The fact that the compare showed changes indicates tha the local sync states 
were correct but the sync view had not picked up the changes. This could be 
due to an event not getting through or, more likely, an incorrect clean 
indicator on a parent folder. He works disconnected on the weekend usign an 
external tool (Word) and does a refresh local to bring his changes into 
Eclipse."

Chose File > Exit.
The workbench window closed, but Eclipse did not terminate.

Strangely, the stack shows I was running RemoveRootAction from CVS, but I could 
have sworn I was nowhere near this action in the UI.

the top right corner (Variables view, Expressions, Break points, Display etc.)

The problem is that in this layout the variables view is often getting 
obscured as a side effect of another operation, e.g., changing a break point 
property or a evaluating an expression. 

Suggest the following layout changes:
* stack the display view in the area of the console view (the display view)
* stack the break point view in the area of the console view

This means breakpoint manipulation or expression evaluation doesn't require 
changing the stacking order in the top right stack.

I'm working with this layout since some and it works well."

by defining primary default feature with its own images, welcome and etc. In 
general, everything looks fine (icon, welcome page and about info are taken 
from my feature), but there are 2 problems:

1. splash.bmp is not taken from within the feature. I put splash.bmp 
under ...eclipse\plugins\my.feature (together with about/welcome stuff which is
applied correctly). I noticed that there is ...eclipse\.config\config.ini
file which contains the following: osgi.splashPath = 
platform:/base/plugins/org.eclipse.platform. If I manually edit this entry to 
include path to my feature plugin - the correct splash is shown. It seems that 
config.ini is copied from org.eclipse.update.configuration plugin during first-
time eclipse invocation without updating it to the proper path matching the 
primary default feature. 

2. plugin_customization.ini file found under my feature plugin (again, together 
with welcome/about/images) is not picked up. Currently, I use 
-plugincustomization command line parameter to ensure it is used, but
it seems that it is supposed to be done automatically at the moment my
feature is set as primary and default. 


User ""Fred"" responded to this problem in eclipse.platform newsgroup with the 
following:
""I have exactly the same 2 problems. Everything was OK in 3.0 M2 but this looks 
like a bug in 3.0 M6."""
50592,, many refresh jobs after doing merge  ,,platform-team-inbox@eclipse.org,major,P3,1/26/2004 6:30,3/22/2004 22:43,,42,"I20040121

After doing a merge of a previous branch into HEAD, it seems that these merge
""synchronization partners"" stay around in the Synchronize view's dropdown.
Currently I have four entries in the dropdown:

CVS Merge: v20031021_Root_editorWork to editorWork
CVS Merge: v20031021_Root_editorWork to editorWork
CVS Merge: v20031021_Root_editorWork to editorWork
CVS Workspace

That the first three entries stay in the dropdown in the sense of a ""history"" or
most recently used synchronizations is ok. The problem however is that it seems
that all these partners get refreshed when I just want to refresh the CVS
Workspace. Since the merge synchronization partners get reset automagically to
""Compare Content ignoring Whitespace"" on every workbench restart, these
refreshes take forever.

-> to me it seems that the not selected entries should not be refreshed when the
refresh button is pressed. Major for me as it happens every time I synchronize."

4. Install CDT 2.0 (<a href=""http://update.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/updates/builds/2.0"">http://update.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/updates/builds/2.0</a>)

Renaming C:\eclipseM6 to C:\eclipse does not fix the problem.

reset. However, there is not event to inform listeners when the reset is complete.

We would like a ""resetComplete"" notification because we have a part listener that we'd like to 
deregister during a reset. With the reset event, we know when to remove our listener. But we need 
the resetComplete to know when to add the listener back.

We need to do this for our view context support, which automatically opens/closes views for the 
user. In order to minimize disruptiveness, we don't automatically open/close a view that the user 
has manually opened or closed. We do this with a part listener. This mechanism currently catches 
views that are closed during a perspective reset, but we don't want it to."

Open up the item node for each one - you will see the same contents for the 
sites opened after the first as for the first. The host names resolve to the

looks as though sourceforge is looking for a header (host?) to determine what

Steps to reproduce.

(contained in the plug-in) to the Ant classpath. This works fine if the 'Run 
in the same JRE as the workspace' option is turned ON. However if I turn the 
option OFF (which is the default in 3.0M6 I believe), then the jars are not 
used. I can tell because the build.xml file that I'm trying to run Ant on uses 
a custom task that is contained in one of the jar files. The custom task is 
found in the former case but not in the latter. I don't see any errors in 
the .log file.

Here's an excerpt from my plugin.xml:

writing doc for the command line and system properties.  Could you fill in the 
details for each arg and also note which ones can be spec'd via 
System.properties (we have been moving to a model where most configuration can 
be done by properties and command line args are just a convenience mechanism) 

Also, could you comment on which args can be deprecated in light of the new 
configuration structure and the reduced need to restart.  For exmaple, -
initialize is only used by the runtime to control some aspect of the splash.  I 
suggest that we separate the concerns and if update still needs -initialize, 
that's cool but people wanting/not wanting a splash should spec the appropriate 
runtime command line args.

The server does support SSH2 connections but is perhaps not properly

not hang indefinitely, For CVS, we use a timeout to ensure that this does not 
happen. Perhaps a similar approach can be used with sftp.

- Had created a clean environment, brought in some source files from CVS and 
rebuilt successfully.
- Java Perspective
- created a new Java Project and played in it briefly
- created a new Plug-in Project (indicated it was a Java project - as opposed 
to a simple project) and asked to create a blank plug-in project
- got the following NPE and have been unable to reproduce it

51690,, [Coolbar] ToolBarManagers are not updated along with the CoolBarManager  ,,douglas.pollock@gmail.com,normal,P3,2/11/2004 12:52,3/25/2004 17:19,,9,"This seems to be a regression from the re-write of the CoolBarManager.update()
method.  The individual ToolBarManagers aren't getting asked to update their
ToolBar (by adding or removing items), and so the list of ToolItems in a ToolBar
stay static until the ToolItems are destroyed and recreated.

This appears to only happen with the Activity Manager work done by Kim Horne. 
Try removing the Java activity while in the Java perspective.  The run and debug
tool bar items do not disappear.  (activity plugin required from the
platform-ui-home web site)

Counter-example: open a Java source file, and the GotoNextAnnotationActions appear.

This could be an issue with not marking something dirty?  I'm going back and
looking at Kosta's old update methods to look for insights."

The files ""stuff.properties"" and ""build.xml"" are in the root dir of a project

VM, the property ""name"" is not found. If I run in a separate VM, the 
property ""name"" is found. However, since the properties file is not in 
c:\temp, the property should not be found. It looks like the sep VM case is 
ignoring the base directory setting."

TableItem.getBounds(int) returns the bounds relative to the whole (unscrolled) 
table area.  As a result, when the table is scrolled, the bounds are incorrect.

The fix is to call gtk_tree_view_tree_to_widget_coords before returning the x, 
y part.

I have a hack of this in my workspace and it works.

This impacts TableCursor among other things."

51831,, StyledText doesn't specify contents of its SelectionEvents  ,,grant_gayed@ca.ibm.com,normal,P3,2/12/2004 8:56,2/13/2004 14:20,,22,"StyledText offers to send out SelectionEvents, but I found no specification
about the contents of the SelectionEvent. SelectionEvent says that x and y
fields are Widget-specific, but doesn't link to StyledText.

StyledText#addSelectionListener(..) also doesn't specify the contents of the
SelectionEvent.

Looking at the implementation, I found that StyledText#sendSelectionEvent()
fills the Event.x and Event.y fields from the field StyledText#selection. At the
definition of this field, I found a wrong line comment, which reads...
  Point selection = new Point(0, 0);  // x is character offset, y is length
But when I look at the rest of the class, it seems as if
- x is the start character offset
- y is the offset of the next character after the selection (and NOT the length)

Therefore, I suggest:
- completing the Javadoc of StyledText#addSelectionListener()
- correcting the erroneous comment of field StyledText#selection"
