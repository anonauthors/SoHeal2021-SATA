69952,, ILaunchConfigurationListener's launchConfigurationRemoved gets a configuration that doesn't exist  ,,krbarnes@ca.ibm.com,enhancement,P3,7/13/2004 13:58,8/4/2004 11:01,,20,"When a listener is added to a launch manager and launchConfigurationRemoved() is
called, it's ILaunchConfiguration object exists, holds the data to get a
configuration... and that configuration no longer exists on disk. By the wording
in the IDE, this makes sense (""Parameters: configuration - the deleted launch
configuration"") except that one would hope one could get data out of said
configuration... but since it's been deleted, one can't. The getAttribute()
function throws a CoreException.

This enhancement request is to clarify and(or) make the removed function more
useful. Taking away the argument (so launchConfigurationRemoved would have no
arguments) would clarify how it works, and adding a just-before-deleting
listener would mean that developers could take actions with knowledge of the
data in the configuration.

To confirm that it's deleted first, make a minimal class that has knowledge of
the launch manager (ie, a launch tab) and add a listener. Put a breakpoint on
the first line of the ...Removed() function, and check the filesystem when it
stops there. This was only duped on w2k, because that's my dev box here."

uses to run the product. As a minimum it should have a product-specific name 
and icon. Currently, constructing such a launcher requires a C compiler and 
other OS-specific tools. We will investigate providing template launchers 
which can be instantiated by PDE when assembling a product for a given OS.

like an archive. Conversely, in other cases, something that is logically a 
single object is stored across multiple files. This discrepancy between 
logical and physical creates problems for common operations such as searching, 
comparing, and versioning, which need to work in the physical realm. Eclipse 
should support some way of mapping between a logical view and the physical 
organization of files on disk. [Platform Core, Platform UI, Team]"
